Wrapping Up

You did it! You traced a URL request from the browser all the way to the server hosting it and itâ€™s response back to the browser to be rendered. We covered the relationship between websites, servers, IP addresses and stepped through each of the steps that your browser goes through when you type a URL into your browser and press enter. For review, here are those six steps:

    You type a URL in your browser and press Enter
    Browser looks up IP address for the domain
    Browser initiates TCP connection with the server
    Browser sends the HTTP request to the server
    Server processes request and sends back a response
    Browser renders the content
